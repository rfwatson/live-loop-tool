h1. Live-loop-tool

The best way to understand, is to watch it in action.

Live-loop-tool is not released as a piece of stable, finished software, more as an interesting piece of code. 

h2. Requirements

* "SuperCollider":http://supercollider.sourceforge.net

* a MIDI keyboard plugged in to make the most of it.

* OSX (unless you want to change the GUI stuff to be cross-platform..;)

h2. Installation

* Copy the files in @classes/@ into your SC class load path. Usually this is something like @~/Application\ Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/@

* In SuperCollider, open @start-here.rtf@

* Follow the instructions in that file

bq. *There's been a minimum of effort gone into making it easy to install or stable to operate! Use at your own risk.*

h2. Usage

There are three parts of the system.

* a buffer manager used for loading and organising drum hits

* a probabilistic drum sequencer used for playing them

* a live effects unit which does some cool stuff to the output

You should be able to figure out how it all works. Perhaps at some point I'll write some more instructions..!
